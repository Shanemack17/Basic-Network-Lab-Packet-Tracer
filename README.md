# Basic-Network-Lab-Packet-Tracer
This is a simple networking lab I built in Cisco Packet Tracer to practice basic setup and connectivity.   I connected two PCs to a switch, and the switch uplinks to a single router interface.   After assigning IP addresses and configuring the router, I tested communication between the two PCs with a ping.
