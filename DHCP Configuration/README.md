# DHCP Configuration Lab ‚Äì Packet Tracer

## üìñ Overview
This lab demonstrates how to configure a Cisco router to act as a DHCP server for a small network.  
In many real-world environments, end-user devices get their IP configuration automatically.  
By completing this lab, I‚Äôve shown that I can:
- Configure a router interface,
- Set up and manage a DHCP pool,
- Verify that end devices receive valid IP addresses,
- Troubleshoot and test connectivity.

## üñ•Ô∏è Topology
![Topology](Topology.png)

**Devices used:**
- üñß Cisco 2960 Switch  
- üì° Cisco 1841 Router  
- üíª 2 PCs (PC0, PC1)

**Why:** This simulates a simple office network where all devices connect through a switch to a single router that handles IP address management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps

### 1. Configure the Router Interface
We assign an IP address to the router‚Äôs internal interface so it can act as the default gateway for the network.

```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
interface fastEthernet 0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
end
write memory
```
‚úÖ *Interface configured successfully:*

### 2. Configure the DHCP Service on the Router
We create a DHCP pool so the router can automatically assign IP addresses to devices.  
We also exclude certain addresses (like the router‚Äôs own IP) so they aren‚Äôt handed out to clients.

```plaintext
configure terminal
ip dhcp pool LAB
 network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.1.1
 dns-server 8.8.8.8
exit
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
end
write memory
```
‚úÖ *DHCP pool configured successfully:*

### 3. Configure PCs to Obtain IP via DHCP
On each PC, go to **Desktop > IP Configuration** and select **DHCP**.  
The PC should receive an IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS from the router automatically.

‚úÖ *Example from PC0:*  
![IP_Config](IP_Config.png)

---

### 4. Test Connectivity
We test by pinging from each PC to the router and between PCs.  
Successful pings show that:
- The router‚Äôs DHCP pool is working,
- Both PCs are on the same network,
- The router is functioning as the default gateway.

‚úÖ *Ping from PC0 to Router:*

‚úÖ **What this demonstrates:**  
I can set up dynamic IP address management in a simulated network environment, verify connectivity, and document the entire process ‚Äî a skill directly applicable to troubleshooting and configuring networks in an entry-level IT or help desk role.
